# ESP8266 Button for HomeAssistant

Sends button presses to your Home Assistant as [a binary sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/binary_sensor/).

Adjust the `url` variable in `main.py` to match the API URL of your Home Assistant instance and the `payload_template` variable to change the button name.

[The 1-button shield](https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d1_mini_shields:1-button_shield) has the button connected to pin 1.
